Any unit can visit this shop and buy general upgrades including melee and ranged damage and strikes, hitpoints, and movement. Besides these basic upgrades, many units also have unique upgrades that they can buy from this shop. For example, lawful units can buy a holy amulet and chaotic units can buy nightstalk. Also, if you use your original leader (the one you are controlling right now), the shopkeeper will give you access to a few powerful and unique upgrades. All shop items have descriptions that you can see by scrolling to the right. This shop can by identified from its label or as a white temple. However, upgrades from this shop add to a unit's upgrade limit of 5 (6 for leaders). This means that any unit (besides leaders) can only buy 5 upgrades from this shop. The shop will not open for units that have already reached their upgrade limit. However, don't fret, because 5 upgrades from this shop is enough to make a very powerful unit. In addition to this, the available upgrades are increased by 1 each time a unit advances (but none for AMLA). But if you are really desperate for upgrades, you can buy one after you reach 0 upgrades remaining if you do not leave the shop at 0. However, this angers the shopkeeper and he will ignore you from that point on."

If a unit buys a potion, it goes into the team inventory, which can be viwed by right-clicking any hex and selecting 'Potions.' Potions can also be given to other players by selecting 'Give a Potion' from your this menu. This brings up a screen identical to those of the give unit and give gold menus. Potions can be drunk by selecting 'Use a Potion' from the 'Potions' menu. The effects of these potions can be viewed in the shop or in the use potion menu. Using a potion is only available if you selected 'Potions' on one of your own units, and giving a potion is only available if you selected the menu from your leader's hex."

An experience point can be bought here for 2 gold, or sold here in exchange for 1 gold. This should be fairly self-explanatory. However, in order to prevent players from selling experience of powerful max-level units several times, a unit can only sell experience once and buy experience once."
